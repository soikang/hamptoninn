I guess is convenient if you are flying. I chose this hotel for the price and because it was not so far from Casino del Sol. Place is good for the price, breakfast is not that bad for a free one. Coffee was great tough. The room was clean but the furniture seems kind of old. Room was quiet although sometimes when other room's door was closing or opening it seemed like it was ours. Pool was not clean, there are several trees around it and a lot of leaves were on it and also there were bees and wasps around the pool, some of them fell on it. Needs more attention. Staff was nice although we did not interact much other than check in check out, and requested more towels. Like I said, it is ok if you need to go to the airport, and price is good.
