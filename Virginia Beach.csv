The pros: The location was perfect right on the beach next to all the entertainment and restaurants. Free breakfast with a descent selection. . The cons: The only pool this hotel had was indoor! It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel. We figured we had the beach so the pool was not a factor. But we went with kids and the beach can be exhausting!
